# glassDetection_LBP_ML
This project is developed based on Machine Learning. 
1. Preprocessing the images and get the location of the faces. 
2. Aligning the face and automatically normalizing it by the face alignment method. 
3. Applying Robust Local Binary Pattern to get the feature sets from the area around eyes. 
4. A model was trained through several sets of region of interest (ROI) from sample images and a support vector machine (SVM) received the extracted feature and output the classification results.
